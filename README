Portfolio App
_____________

The Portfolio app makes it easy to set up a portfolio website.
Either place the contents of this directory into your web server or pull it from
git. 

Requirements
___________

* PHP 5.4 or greater
* MySQL 
* Apache

Setup
_____

1) Run SQL document sql/Portfolio.sql to setup database. Make sure the database is
   called `Portfolio`. Or go to sql/Portfolio.sql and change every occurrence of 
   'Portfolio' to the name of your database.
2) Change the database connection information in config/db.php.
   Will need to change the 'username' and 'password' field.
3) Place the contents of portfolioAPP into the root directory of your web server.
   The file structure of the app has 'public_html' being the point of access for 
   the website, which is the default location for most web servers.
4) If you have a different directory name, the image management needs to
   know where to look for images. So go to src/bootstrap.php - app['ImageMangment']
   and change 'public_html' to your new directory name.
5) open the website to www.domainName.com/admin.
6) in the login form type
	username: 'username'
	password: 'password'
   to enter into the admin area for the first time.
7) hit 'Personal Info' and change the password and username for next time.
